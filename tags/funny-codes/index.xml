Hope the following codes make you smile, too.
Although I hardly use Ruby programming language for a long time, I still remember a piece of code from Sidekiq, which is a asynchronous jobs framework for Ruby:
# https://github.com/mperham/sidekiq/blob/5ebd857e3020d55f5c701037c2d7bedf9a18e897/lib/sidekiq.rb#L51-L53 module Sidekiq # ... def self.❨╯°□°❩╯︵┻━┻ puts &amp;#34;Calm down, yo.&amp;#34; end ... end Aha! It is a unused method of which the name is a emoticon, and seems that the author of the code is annoying while he or she was writing it.</description></item></channel></rss>
