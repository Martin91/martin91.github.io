&amp;ldquo;linuxcommand: logrotate&amp;rdquo;:http://linuxcommand.org/man_pages/logrotate8.html logrotate is designed to ease administration of systems that generate large numbers of log files. Normally, logrotate is run as a daily cron job.
Some important knowledges:
Any number of config files may be given. Later config files may override the options given in earlier files, so the order in which the logrotate config files are listed in is important. Normally, a single config file which includes any other config files which are needed should be used.</description></item></channel></rss>
